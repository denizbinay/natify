# NATIFY - lightweight form validation (<2kb)

> **Warning**
> Don't use this in production!

Looking for a lightweight form validation library that also allows frontend warning I got frustrated. Either it was too expensive, too heavy or too cumbersome. Thereby I became aware of the constraint api of the browsers. This works wonderfully and with a few lines a lot is done. But sometimes it behaves strange. It has only one invalid event and none for valid. The pseudo class invalid fires at pageload which is very bad for the UX and so on.

I wanted to keep this very lean approach and so i'm started working on a library that extends the native API. Unfortunately I am not a skilled library developer. I am sure I did some things wrong. Still the approach is cool and I couldn't find any other project like it. I would be happy if you share this with me in the discussion section of the repository!
